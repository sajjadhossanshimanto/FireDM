# How to use FireDM:
Refer to user guide at https://github.com/pyIDM/FireDM/blob/master/docs/user_guide.md

----------------------
# Portable FireDM versions:
  
Run FireDM without any installation (recommended) 
 - **Windows portable version** ([Download!](https://github.com/pyIDM/FireDM/releases/latest)):  
   available in .zip format.  
   unzip, and run from FireDM.exe, no installation required.
   
 - **Linux portable version** ([Download!](https://github.com/pyIDM/FireDM/releases/latest)):   
   available in .AppImage format.  
   download file, then mark it as executable, and run it, no installation required,
   tested on ubuntu, mint, and manjaro.<br>
   note: ffmpeg is not included and must be installed separately if not exist <br>
   
   mark file as executable by right clicking the file> Properties> Permissions> Allow executing file as a program, 
   or from terminal by `chmod +x FireDM_xxx.AppImage` <br>
   
   To check for ffmpeg use this command:
   ```
    which ffmpeg
   
    # expected output if installed
    /usr/bin/ffmpeg
   ```

   if ffmpeg is missing you can install it by `sudo apt install ffmpeg` on debian based or `sudo pacman -S ffmpeg`
    on Arch based distros.
----------------------

# Manually installing FireDM:
- **Linux:**

    - UBUNTU:
    
        1- verify you have minimum python version 3.6+
        
            `python3`
        
        2- install pip:
        
            `sudo apt-install python3-pip`
            
        3- install dependencies:
        
            `sudo apt install ffmpeg libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev python3-pip python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk python3-tk`
            
        4- install fonts
        
            `sudo apt install fonts-symbola fonts-linuxlibertine fonts-inconsolata fonts-emojione`
        
        5- install firedm
        
            `python3 -m pip install firedm --user --upgrade --no-cache`
             or if you run into a problem
            `sudo python3 -m pip install firedm --upgrade --no-cache`
  

- **PyPi**:<br>
     on windows replace "python3" with "python" in below commands

    `python3 -m pip install firedm --user --upgrade --no-cache`
    or
    `sudo python3 -m pip install firedm --upgrade --no-cache`
    
    then you can run application from Terminal by:  
    `python3 -m firedm`          

    or just  
    `firedm` an executable "i.e. firedm.exe on windows" will be
    located at "python/scripts", if it doesn't work append
    "python/scripts" folder to PATH.


-  **run from github source code**:<br> 
   FireDM is a python app. so, it
   can run on any platform that can run python, To run from source, you
   have to have a python installed, "supported python versions is 3.6,
   3.7, and 3.8", then download or clone this repository, and run
   FireDM.py (it will install the other required python packages
   automatically if missing) if FireDM failed to install required
   packages, you should install it manually, refer to "Dependencies"
   section below.

-  **Build FireDM yourself**:
   -  get the source code from github: (recommended for latest updated
      version, also shallow clone is preferred)  
      `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pyIDM/FireDM.git`

   - or get the source code from PyPi:  
   navigate to https://pypi.org/project/firedm/#files and download a tar
   ball, example file name "FireDM-2020.3.22.tar.gz", then extract it

   - open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to firedm folder then type below command  
        `python3 setup.py install  --user`

   - run FireDM from Terminal by typing:  
        `python3 -m firedm`     or  just `firedm`

# Known Issues:
- Linux X-server will raise an error if some fonts are missing especially emoji fonts, for more info refer to [issue #200](https://github.com/pyIDM/FireDM/issues/200).


- Mac - Tkinter, as mentioned in "python.org" the Apple-supplied Tcl/Tk 8.5 has serious bugs that can cause application crashes. If you wish to use Tkinter, do not use the Apple-supplied Pythons. Instead, install and use a newer version of Python from python.org or a third-party distributor that supplies or links with a newer version of Tcl/Tk. <br>
refer to [issue #113](https://github.com/pyIDM/FireDM/issues/113)


---

# Dependencies:
below are the requirements to run from source:
- Python 3.6+: tested with python 3.6 on windows, and 3.7, 3.8 on linux
- tkinter
- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) : for merging audio with youtube DASH videos "it will be installed automatically on windows"
- Fonts: (Linux X-server will raise an error if some fonts are missing especially emoji fonts, below are the 
recommended fonts to be installed, for more info refer to [issue #200](https://github.com/pyIDM/FireDM/issues/200).)

    ```
    ttf-linux-libertine 
    ttf-inconsolata 
    ttf-emojione
    ttf-symbola
    noto-fonts
    ```
Required python packages: 
- [pycurl](http://pycurl.io/docs/latest/index.html): is a Python interface to libcurl / curl as our download engine,
- [youtube_dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl): famous youtube downloader, limited use for meta information extraction only but videos are downloaded using pycurl
- [youtube-dlc](https://github.com/blackjack4494/yt-dlc): community version of youtube-dl
- [certifi](https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi): required by 'pycurl' for validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates,
- [plyer](https://github.com/kivy/plyer): for systray area notification.
- [awesometkinter](https://github.com/Aboghazala/AwesomeTkinter): for
  application gui.
- [pillow](https://python-pillow.org/): imaging library for python
- [pystray](https://github.com/moses-palmer/pystray): for systray icon


Note: FireDM will do its best to install missing packages automatically using pip3 once you run it. 

you can install required packages manually using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# what is the benefit of open source, compared to closed-source/Proprietary software if both are free?
As said, **"if the product is free, then you are the product"**, most
free closed-source software collect data about you, some of them are
toxic and plant trojans and spy-wares in your system, with open source,
nothing hidden, and source code exposed to thousands of programmers, no
one can play dirty games.


Need to mention, this project is never made to compete with other
download managers, it is just a "hopefully useful" addition.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### note for pycurl: <br>
for windows users:
normal pip install i.e `python -m pip install pycurl` might fail on windows because you need to build libcurl on your system first which is a headache. 
your best choice if pip fail is to download exe file for pycurl from its official download [link](https://dl.bintray.com/pycurl/pycurl/), find the file that match your windows system and python version installed on your system, last checked on 12-06-2020, found available files for almost all Python versions upto version 3.8

example: if you have python 3.6 installed on windows 32bit, you should download "pycurl-7.43.0.2.win32-py3.6.exe" file and install it, 
another example: if you have python 3.7 running on windows 64 bit, you should choose and download "pycurl-7.43.0.3.win-amd64-py3.7.exe" file

other download options include a wheel, zip file, or even a windows installer

for linux users:
there is no issues, since most linux distros have curl preinstalled, so pycurl will link with libcurl library to get built with no issues, checked with python versions 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8 working with no problems.
<br>


### note for [Youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl): <br>
youtube website changes frequently, if this application failed to retrieve video/playlist data
you should update youtube-dl module thru FireDM setting tab or manually by
```
python -m pip install youtube_dl --upgrade
```
